This is a simple demo to get started with react-hook-form to manage forms in your react app.
Its much faster and easy than writing your own code or even using formik.

Steps to see demo-

1- Clone this repo.
2- Run npm i on your local code editor inside the project folder.
3- Run npm start.
4- Goto http://localhost:3000/ , if it doesn't redirects you automatically.

Cheers!
